Reminder for stupid people
Stuff inside <> indicates code when it would be otherwise ambiguous

- First create your local directory
- Then do git init
- You can't check out (switch) branches with nothing inside of them, so make something.
- <git config user.name "Chike Nwaenie" --global> if I created the repository, global means this file is stored on my computer BUT outside the repository I made it in. Idk why this matters
